# Spotify Genre Tagging Bot

An Android-based automation that scans tracks and playlists on Spotify, identifies the most likely genres using on-device flows, and tags or exports those genres for downstream use. This reduces manual curation time for editors and growth teams while improving playlist consistency and recommendation quality. The Spotify Genre Tagging Bot uses human-like interaction and multi-device scaling to deliver fast, reliable tagging runs at scale.

## Introduction
**What it does:** Automates Spotify app navigation on Android to read track/artist/album context, infer genres from UI elements and heuristics, then writes structured results (e.g., CSV/Sheets/DB) for tagging workflows.  
**What it automates:** Repetitive playlist auditing, track-by-track metadata lookup, genre categorization, and bulk export.  
**Benefit:** Saves hours of manual effort, standardizes genre taxonomy, and accelerates playlist growth and editorial QA.

### Automating Spotify Genre Classification & Export
- Parses track detail pages and context menus to collect available labels, moods, and related-artist hints, then applies rules/ML lookups to infer genres.
- Simulates natural scrolling, delays, and micro-gestures to reduce detection and avoid UX interruptions.
- Supports device farms (real or emulated) for concurrent tagging of large playlists and libraries.
- Exports clean, deduplicated genre data mapped to your taxonomy for downstream pipelines.

## Core Features (must include 8–10)

- **Real Devices and Emulators:** Works on Android phones/tablets and emulators (Bluestacks/Nox). Supports mixed fleets for cost-effective throughput.
- **No-ADB Wireless Automation:** Optional wireless control (scrcpy/ADB over TCP) with fallback to UI Automator/Appium bridge for cable-free labs.
- **Mimicking Human Behavior:** Randomized dwell times, inertial scrolls, partial swipes, back/forward navigation patterns to mirror real usage.
- **Multiple Accounts Support:** Rotate between multiple Spotify accounts with per-profile cookies/session handling and configurable cooldowns.
- **Multi-Device Integration:** Queue-driven scheduler runs 10–300+ devices; central coordinator splits playlists into shards to avoid overlap.
- **Exponential Growth for Your Account:** Faster and more accurate tagging → higher playlist cohesion → better saves/retention and organic growth.
- **Premium Support:** SLA-backed assistance, device farm guidance, and custom taxonomy integration.

**Additional Feature Set**

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| **Genre Heuristics Engine** | Combines UI strings (e.g., “About”, related artists), local rules, and optional offline ML embeddings to infer primary/secondary genres. |
| **Taxonomy Mapper** | Maps inferred labels to your controlled vocabulary (e.g., “alt indie” → “Indie/Alternative”), with conflict resolution and audit logs. |
| **Batch & Resume** | Checkpointing ensures long runs can resume after app crashes/restarts without reprocessing tagged items. |
| **Proxy & IP Rotation** | Optional mobile/residential proxy routing for API-adjacent lookups (e.g., cover art, ancillary pages) without tying to a single egress. |
| **Observability & Alerts** | Structured logs, per-device dashboards, and alerting on anomaly rates (e.g., too many “unknown” genres or UI load failures). |

## How It Works (must)
1. **Input or Trigger** — The automation is triggered through the Appilot dashboard, where the user selects source playlists/albums, tagging rules, output destinations (CSV/Sheets/DB), and device concurrency.
2. **Core Logic** — Appilot controls the Android device/emulator via UI Automator/Appium: opens Spotify, navigates items, extracts visible metadata, applies the Genre Heuristics Engine + Taxonomy Mapper, and records results.
3. **Output or Action** — The system writes tagged outputs (track URI, title, artist, primary/secondary genres, confidence) to the configured sink and can trigger webhooks for downstream processing.
4. **Other functionalities**— Retry logic on UI failures, screenshot-on-error, per-device isolation, parallel queueing, and detailed logging are configurable in the Appilot dashboard.

## Tech Stack (must)
- **Language:** Kotlin, Java, Python, JavaScript  
- **Frameworks:** Appium, UI Automator, Espresso, Robot Framework, Cucumber  
- **Tools:** Appilot, Android Debug Bridge (ADB), Appium Inspector, Bluestacks, Nox Player, Scrcpy, Firebase Test Lab, MonkeyRunner, Accessibility  
- **Infrastructure:** Dockerized device farms, Cloud-based emulators, Proxy networks, Parallel Device Execution, Task Queues, Real device farm.

## Use Cases (must)
- **Playlist Editors** use it to bulk-tag new submissions, so they can maintain consistent genre curation without manual lookup.  
- **Music Startups** use it to standardize metadata for recommendation engines, so they can improve match quality and reduce cold-start issues.  
- **Agencies/Labels** use it to audit catalog health across accounts, so they can quickly spot miscategorized tracks and fix discovery.  
- **Developers** use it to feed clean genre labels into A/B tests, so they can validate playlist strategy faster.

## FAQs
**How do I configure this automation for multiple accounts?**  
Provide per-account credentials in `credentials.env` and list profiles in `devices.yaml`. The scheduler isolates sessions and staggers logins to prevent collisions.

**Does it support proxy rotation or anti-detection?**  
Yes. Configure proxy pools (mobile/residential) and enable human-like behaviors. The bot randomizes gestures and introduces jitter to reduce patterns.

**Can I schedule it to run periodically?**  
Yes. Use the Appilot dashboard or cron-like schedules to refresh tagging (e.g., nightly on target playlists) with resume-from-checkpoint enabled.

**What happens if Spotify UI changes?**  
Selectors are centralized in `ui_selectors.json`. Update selectors or add fallbacks; the retry and screenshot-on-error flows help you patch quickly.

**Can I integrate a custom genre taxonomy?**  
Yes. Define mappings in `rules.yaml` and `taxonomy.md`. The mapper handles synonyms, merges, and priority rules.

## Performance & Reliability Benchmarks (must)
- **Execution Speed:** Processes ~100–180 tracks per device per 10 minutes depending on UI latency and heuristic depth.  
- **Success Rate:** 95% successful tag assignments on stable UI builds with validated selectors.  
- **Scalability:** Proven on 50–300 Android devices; architecture patterns extend to ~1,000 with horizontal queue scaling.  
- **Resource Efficiency:** Lightweight workers (~200–300MB RAM per emulator) with adaptive throttling under thermal or CPU pressure.  
- **Error Handling:** Exponential backoff, per-step retries, crash recovery with checkpoints, anomaly alerts, and structured logs for root-cause analysis.
